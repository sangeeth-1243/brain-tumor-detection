## More Info: Model Details and Training Process

### Overview

This section provides a more in-depth explanation of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model used for the project, detailing the model architecture, training process, and how predictions are made. I will try to explain each utility with its features, role, and why they are used.

### Model Architecture

The model is designed using TensorFlow and Keras and consists of several layers, including convolutional, pooling, dropout, and dense layers. The architecture is specifically tailored for binary classification of MRI images to detect the presence of brain tumors.

#### Layers

1. **Input Layer**
   - **Shape**: (50, 50, 3)
   - **Description**: Accepts color images resized to 50x50 pixels (best based on avaiable resolutions and reasonable memory usage).
   - **Reason**: Standardizes the input size for the model to ensure consistency across all images.

2. **First Convolutional Layer**
   - **Filters**: 32
   - **Kernel Size**: (3, 3)
   - **Activation**: ReLU
   - **Padding**: SAME
   - **Description**: Extracts features from the input image using 32 different filters.
   - **Reason**: Detects low-level features such as edges and textures (these are crucial for understanding the structure of MRI images).

3. **First Max-Pooling Layer**
   - **Pool Size**: (2, 2)
   - **Strides**: 2
   - **Description**: Reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.
   - **Reason**: Reduces computational complexity and helps in making the feature detection process invariant to small translations.

4. **Second Convolutional Layer**
   - **Filters**: 64
   - **Kernel Size**: (3, 3)
   - **Activation**: ReLU
   - **Padding**: SAME
   - **Description**: Extracts more complex features from the feature maps using 64 filters.
   - **Reason**: Captures higher-level features and patterns which are very important for distinguishing between normal and abnormal brain tissues.

5. **Second Max-Pooling Layer**
   - **Pool Size**: (2, 2)
   - **Strides**: 2
   - **Description**: Further reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.
   - **Reason**: Continues to reduce computational load and helps in extracting more abstract features.

6. **Dropout Layer**
   - **Rate**: 0.6
   - **Description**: Prevents overfitting by randomly setting 60% of the input units to 0 during training.
   - **Reason**: Regularizes the model by preventing it from becoming too reliant on any specific neurons to improve its generalization to new data.

7. **Flatten Layer**
   - **Description**: Flattens the 3D feature maps to a 1D vector to be fed into the dense layers.
   - **Reason**: Prepares the data for the fully connected dense layers by transforming it into a suitable format.

8. **First Dense Layer**
   - **Units**: 128
   - **Activation**: ReLU
   - **Regularization**: L2 with a factor of 0.001
   - **Description**: Learns high-level features and patterns from the flattened input.
   - **Reason**: Adds non-linearity and helps in learning complex patterns that are necessary for classification.

9. **Output Dense Layer**
   - **Units**: 1
   - **Activation**: Sigmoid
   - **Description**: Produces a probability indicating the presence of a tumor.
   - **Reason**: Outputs a probability score that helps in the binary classification decisions (tumor/no tumor).

### Training Process

#### Data Preparation

1. **Loading Data**
   - The `get_samples` function loads and shuffles image file paths for training.
   - Images are read, resized to 50x50 pixels, and labeled based on their directory ("yes" for tumor, "no" for no tumor).
   - **Reason**: Makes sure that the data is in a uniform format and that there is a balanced distribution of classes.

2. **Splitting Data**
   - Data is split into training and validation sets, with the last 400 images reserved for validation.
   - **Reason**: This allows the model to be evaluated on unseen data to help in monitoring its generalization ability.

#### Model Compilation

- **Optimizer**: AdamW (Adam with Weight Decay)
  - **Learning Rate**: 0.001
  - **Weight Decay**: 1e-5
  - **Reason**: AdamW combines the benefits of Adam (adaptive learning rates) with weight decay, and this helps in preventing overfitting.
- **Loss Function**: Binary Crossentropy
  - **Reason**: Suitable for binary classification tasks as it measures the performance of the model in terms of probability error.
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, AUC (Area Under Curve), Precision, Recall
  - **Reason**: Provides a readable and understandable evaluation of the model’s performance across various aspects.

#### Callbacks

- **Early Stopping**: Monitors validation loss, stops training if it doesn't improve for 30 epochs, and restores the best weights.
  - **Reason**: Prevents overfitting and ensures the model retains the best weights.
- **ReduceLROnPlateau**: Reduces the learning rate by a factor of 0.5 if the validation loss doesn't improve for 5 epochs.
  - **Reason**: Helps in fine-tuning the learning process and lets the model to converge better.
- **TensorBoard**: Logs training process for visualization in TensorBoard.
  - **Reason**: Shows valuable data of the training process and allows for better debugging and understanding of the model’s behavior.
- **ModelCheckpoint**: Saves the best model based on validation precision.
  - **Reason**: Makes sure the best-performing model is saved, which can be used for inference and further evaluation.

#### Training

The `train` function fits the model on the training data, using the specified callbacks to optimize the training process. The model is trained for up to 500 epochs but can stop early if the early stopping criterion is met.

#### Steps

1. **Initialization**: Model and optimizer are initialized with the specified parameters.
2. **Fitting**: Model is trained on the training data with the specified callbacks and validation data.
3. **Evaluation**: After training, the model is evaluated on the validation set to monitor its performance.

### Prediction Process

#### Loading the Model

The `get_model` function loads the trained model and evaluates its performance on a validation set to ensure it is working correctly.

#### Making Predictions

1. **Image Preprocessing**: New MRI images are preprocessed similarly to the training images (resized to 50x50 pixels).
2. **Model Prediction**: The model predicts the probability of a tumor being present.
3. **Output**: The predicted class (tumor/no tumor) and confidence level are shown.

#### Steps

1. **Loading**: The trained model is loaded.
2. **Preprocessing**: The input image is preprocessed to match the training data format.
3. **Prediction**: The model predicts the probability of a tumor.
4. **Output**: The result is displayed, indicating the presence or absence of a tumor with a confidence score.

   - The script loads and preprocesses the images, shuffles them, and splits them into training and validation sets.
   - The CNN model is built with multiple convolutional, pooling, dropout, and dense layers.
   - The model is trained using the training set, with early stopping and learning rate reduction callbacks to optimize the training process.
   - The trained model is saved for later use and testing.

3. **Prediction (predictor.py)**:
   - It loads the trained model and evaluates its performance on a validation set to ensure it is working correctly.
   - It takes new MRI images, preprocesses them similarly to the training images, and uses the model to predict whether a tumor is present.
   - The prediction results, including the confidence level, are printed for evluation and informational purposes.
